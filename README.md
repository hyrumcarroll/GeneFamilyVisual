## Nov 20, 2017 - MTSU Meetings Summary

### New JSON Record Format
Micah helped me realize today that the role of the visualization front-end is to just visualize and therefore to do as little computation as necessary.  Consequently, we need to change the JSON record format specification (from our March 20th notes) to be have the information already processed for layout.  Micah has agreed to lead out on that.  A rough sketch of what we talked about is:

List of visual exons
+ Label (length(s) for now)
+ Visual column index
+ Length (number of visual columns [most will be 1]
+ UTR type [0-2] (0: Not a UTR, 1: partial UTR, 2: full UTR)

List of gene info
+ For each gene:
  + Name
  + Visual exon indices

Micah's going to change his hard-coded example to use a JSON record.  (**Micah, can you have that done by the end of November 30th?**).

### Web server update
The prospects of using a server at CSU have not improved.  Leewood researched the pricing for web hosting companies.  We're looking for a Linux machine.  Additionally, we need to choose a domain name and register it.  (**Leewood, could you research the pricing and how to register a domain name before the end of the month?**)  (**All, who's got a great URL idea (that's not already taken)?**)


### Manuscript Outline
Dr. Seipelt-Thiemann and I had a great meeting this morning. We talked about the manuscript outline and made assignments for each section and sub-section.


### Milestones
Our goal is to submit our manuscript by the end of December.  To accomplish this, we'll need to meet a few more times.  I'll send out a Doodle poll to get everyone's availability.  Below are the remaining to-dos.  **If you see empty square brackets by your name, please fill-in a milestone goal for that item.**  As you complete an item, email everyone so that we can celebrate with you!

key0: "geneFamilyInfo", which is a dictionary, with gene names as keys, and a list of exon properties (dictionaries) as the values  
The exon properties dictionary with the following keys:  
+ start MSA alignment position  
+ end MSA alignment position  
+ visual exon index  
key1: "visualExons", which is a list with each element having the following data:  
	 + (ending) reading frame [0-2]  
	 + Visual exon columns (list of 2 elements, start and end [so most visual exons have the same start and end values])  
	 + UTR type [0-2] (0: Not a UTR, 1: partial UTR, 2: full UTR)  



## Mar 13, 2017  
JSON record format:  
---------------------------------  
dictionary, with gene names as keys, and a list of exon properties (dictionaries) as the values  
The exon properties dictionary with the following keys:  
+ Length  (number of nucleotides)  
+ (ending) reading frame [0-2]  
+ Visual exon columns (list of 2 elements, start and end [so most visual exons have the same start and end values])
